## Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a>
This project is a demo of an app I built to help my marketing consultancy streamline reporting of their LinkedIn Organic, LinkedIn Sponsored and Google Ads advertising campaigns. It is, in roughly equal parts; a useful tool, a demo of my skills and a platform I used to explore technologies such as Docker, Docker Compose and matplotlib with which I had limited experience. For this reason there are places in which the project could be approached more simply but would have provided fewer learning experiences. 

As this is a tool that was also built to provide proprietary reports for clients of an active marketing agency, all the references to that agency and their clients have been stripped out along with connection details to the Linkedin and Google Ads advertising APIs. For this reason, if you wish to get this working in your own right, you will need access to both these APIs (details in the [dependencies](#dependencies) section) and some deliberately ommited config files. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to get this working for yourself and I will do my best to help you.
